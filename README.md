## Federation support

The is our _native federation_ implementation.  It will enable Rocket.Chat to federate with other Rocket.Chat servers directly without bridges or intermdiary servers.  It will add matrix.org protocol compatibitily to Rocket.Chat.

_Currently under active development._

#### Future road map
* synchronizes messages between (occassionally) connected Rocket.Chat servers
* interoperate with other Chat servers/services supporting Federation: including Slack, Skype, IRC, Asterisk, and more
* extend video chat, audio chat, and screensharing to users across the federated servers/services network
* enable control, management, monitoring, communication, and collboration between intelligent devices (things) connected throughout a federated servers/services network; with zero-overhead lightweight junctions to accomodate legacy MQTT islands
