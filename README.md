# Federation 

Federation is now under active development.  The following is synopsis of the current activities.  

## Hubot Freddie - the Federation bridge npm module for Rocket.Chat

https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-freddie

This is a working bot that can be added to any Rocket.Chat server and allows one channel to be federated with other similarly configured Rocket.Chat server.   It works by bridging a channel from a Rocket.Chat server to a Matrix.org synapse homeserver. 

You can see hubot freddie in action on our community server:

The #general channel of our community server https://demo.rocket.chat/channel/general

is bridged via hubot freddie to this paired homeserver and room: 

http://federation.rocket.chat/_matrix/client/#/room/!KgtAjQXVRcuoqmtfHC:federation.rocket.chat

This room can be federated throughout the Matrix.org realm.  Any server in the realm can also be paired with another Rocket.Chat server via hubot freddie.

Ongoing development with hubot freddie is taking place here, contributions welcomed:

## Federation Server

This server will be a matrix.org protocol compatible server written in JavaScript / TypeScript.

### Under active development

# Design

## Log based archiecture
TBD

### Future road map
* synchronizes messages between (occassionally) connected Rocket.Chat servers
* interoperate with other Chat servers/services supporting Federation: including Slack, Skype, IRC, Asterisk, and more
* extend video chat, audio chat, and screensharing to users across the federated servers/services network
* enable control, management, monitoring, communication, and collboration between intelligent devices (things) connected throughout a federated servers/services network; with zero-overhead lightweight junctions to accomodate legacy MQTT islands
