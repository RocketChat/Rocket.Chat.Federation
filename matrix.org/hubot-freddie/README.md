# Installation

```
npm install --save hubot-freddie
```

Next, you must edit the `external-scripts.json` file to load Freddie:

```
[
  ...
  "hubot-freddie"
]
```

# Home Server Application Service Registration

In the `node_modules/hubot-freddie` directory: 

```
npm install
node genASRegFile.js -r -u <URL of hubot-freddie's incoming webhook>
```

This will generate a `rocketchat-registration.yaml` file in the same directory.

Copy this file to both your Rocket.Chat server and Synapse Home Server.  Note the absolute path(s).

On your home server, make sure to add an entry in `homeserver.yaml` to point to this file:

```
app_service_config_files: ["/absolute/path/to/rocketchat-registration.yaml"]
```

You will also need to configure Freddie for your Rocket.Chat server and Synapse Home sever..
